1. This query reports the amount of business that was billed, shipped by status

select
	OI.STATUS,
	sum(OI.QUANTITY) as sum_qty,
	sum(OI.BASE_PRICE) as sum_base_price,
	sum(OI.BASE_PRICE*(1-OI.discount)) as sum_disc_price,
	sum(OI.BASE_PRICE*(1-OI.discount)*(1+OI.TAX)) as sum_charge,
	avg(OI.QUANTITY) as avg_qty,
	avg(OI.BASE_PRICE) as avg_price,
	avg(OI.DISCOUNT) as avg_disc,
	count(*) as count_order
from
	ORDERITEM OI
where
	OI.SHIP_DATE = ?
group by
	OI.STATUS
order by
	OI.STATUS;


2. This query finds which supplier should be selected to place an order for a given part size and part type.

select
	s.name,
	p.id,
	s.address,
	s.phone,
	s.comment
from
	PRODUCT p,
	SUPPLIER s,
	PRODUCTSUPPLIER ps
where
	p.id = ps.product
	and s.id = ps.supplier
	and p.size = [SIZE]
	and p.type like ?
	and ps.cost = (
		select
			min(ps2.cost)
		from 
			PRODUCTSUPPLIER ps2,
			SUPPLIER s2,
		where
			p.id = ps2.product
			and s2.id = ps2.supplier
		)
order by
n.name,
s.name,
p.id;


3.This query determines how much profit is made on a given line of parts, broken out by year

select 
	o_year,
	sum(amount) as sum_profit
from (
	select
		extract(year from o.date) as o_year,
		oi.base_price * (1 - oi.discount) - ps.supply_cost * oi.quantity as amount
	from
		PRODUCT p,
		SUPPLIER s,
		ORDERITEM oi,
		PRODUCTSUPPLIER ps,
		ORDER o
	where
		s.id = oi.supplier
		and ps.supplier = oi.supplier
		and ps.product = oi.product
		and p.id = oi.product
		and o.id = oi.order
		and p.name like ?
) as profit
group by
o_year
order by
o_year desc;
